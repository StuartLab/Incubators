# An Inexpensive 'Homemade' O2/CO2 Regulating Incubator for Mammalian Cell Culture 
> Our incubator is an inexpensive, portable and user friendly device that is capable of regulating O2, CO2 and temperature within physiological ranges. Using an Arduino-based approach to control O2 and CO2 headspace levels via N2 and CO2 gas injection, we were able to convert a temperature-regulating Styrofoam egg incubator into a efficient benchtop cell culture tool comparable to commercial laboratory O2/CO2 incubators. This incubator can be assembled for less than $1000 (CAD), making it highly accessable for biologists seeking to transition towards physiological cell culture practices.

## General Information
- Culturing cells under physiologically-relevant conditions is vital to maintaining cellular phenotypes representative of in vivo biology. While O2 constitutes ~20% of the atmosphere, it's level ranges from 2 to 6% in most mammalian tissues, thus O2/CO2 incubators capable of establishing such conditions are necessary. Unfortuanately, commercial O2/CO2 incubators suitable for mammalian cell culture cost well over CAD $10,000, making them inaccessible to many cell biologists. 
- The "Homemade" O2/CO2 incubator described here works to address this obstacle by providing cell culturists with the means to self assemble an effective O2/CO2 incubator from a standard temperature-regulating Styrofoam egg incubator.  
- The Stuart lab is a large proponent of the importance of physiological conditions in cell culture, thus by making tools to maintain physiological oxygen levels more readily available, we hope to encourage the field to incorporate such practices into standard workflow.
